# DevilutionX - Diablo
[DevilutionX](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx) has a built-in portable mode.  
Move an existing diablo.ini or create a blank one in the same folder as executable. The ini file is the configuration file.  
When running with the ini file in the same folder as the executable, the saves will be saved in the same folder as the executable.
